"This project utilizes data from a fictional coffee chain in New York, including transactional information, product management, sales targets, customer and point-of-sale data, to conduct a detailed analysis of key factors influencing business success. 

Initially, we analyzes and studies business operations, including revenue tracking, store performance, and other factors impacting business activities. This deepens the team's understanding of the coffee chain's operational dynamics and identifies strengths and weaknesses in their business operations. Subsequently, recommendations are proposed to assist the enterprise in addressing their business challenges.

Additionally, the team compares sales revenues across stores and identifies the most efficient operations to pinpoint critical factors contributing to store success, applying these insights to other stores."
